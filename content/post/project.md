### Cost Matters

<table class="tg">
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-vnl4"><span style="font-weight:bold;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);background-color:rgb(240, 240, 240)">Traditional Pipeline</span></th>
    <th class="tg-vnl4"><span style="font-weight:bold;background-color:rgb(239, 239, 239)">POET Pipeline</span></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0pky">Managing and running pipeline involves huge cost. You need at least 1 full time team member per team for CI/CD pipeline. A lot of teams cannot afford even that 1 full time team member to work only on pipeline.</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky"> Due to its simple architecture and design, POET pipeline reduces the support overhead as well as the addition of new feature and capability which is done using containers. <br><br>You do not require a full-time person/specialist in your team to maintain/support the pipeline.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Customer support or need of a CI/CD Specialist (harder to find)

<table class="tg">
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-vnl4"><span style="font-weight:bold;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);background-color:rgb(240, 240, 240)">Traditional Pipeline</span></th>
    <th class="tg-vnl4"><span style="font-weight:bold;background-color:rgb(239, 239, 239)">POET Pipeline</span></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0pky">In any organization the most important thing is how you support your customers whether they are internal or external. There are also challenges in how you get your product adopted, provide training to users and encourage the developers to use the product and contribute back as well. To make sure all this works well, you need a highly skilled, motivated and enthusiastic support team which is hard to find with all the knowledge and skill set.</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">We solved this problem in POET pipeline by keeping the product simple to use and providing enough resources like documentation, tutorial and videos for the dev team to understand the pipeline in a simple way. This helped in expending resources on other capabilities and innovations.</td>
  </tr>

### Design and implementation

</style>

<table class="tg">
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-vnl4"><span style="font-weight:bold;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);background-color:rgb(240, 240, 240);">Traditional Pipeline</span></th>
    <th class="tg-vnl4"><span style="font-weight:bold;background-color:rgb(239, 239, 239);">POET Pipeline</span></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0pky"> In a traditional pipeline development lifecycle, for using Jenkins, you need to have people in your team who can write pipeline as code using Groovy, shell script and automate the processes.<br><br>Furthermore, they must typically have a deeper understanding of their pipeline platform, such as, Jenkins internal concepts, Groovy and other related tools and technologies like JMeter, SonarQube, Selenium, Slack/E-mail, multiple Deployment platforms, Security etc.</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky"> In POET pipeline, we tried to use minimal number of Jenkins plugins so that we don’t have too much dependence on Jenkins. You do not write any “Jenkins code”.Everything is done through pipeline definition file(s) located with the pipeline source code. <br><br>There is no need for people with specific skills needed for Jenkins.</td>
  </tr>

### Learning Curve

<table class="tg">
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-vnl4"><span style="font-weight:bold;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);background-color:rgb(240, 240, 240)">Traditional Pipeline</span></th>
    <th class="tg-vnl4"><span style="font-weight:bold;background-color:rgb(239, 239, 239)">POET Pipeline</span></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-0pky">Many companies are trying to be agile, using scrum framework and adopting a DevOps culture. Instead of having a centralized team to design and maintain the CI/CD pipeline, development teams should have ownership. This makes it critical to provide a simpler system than traditional groovy type pipeline as code.</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">In POET pipeline, the technology underneath is abstracted from the development teams. Any changes in the workflow or new feature or capability additions are done using step containers, which reduces the learning curve quite a bit.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Conclusion

Overall, POET pipeline is a big win-win situation for both the stakeholders, the developers as well the Enterprise delivery pipeline team. POET Pipeline is all about customer satisfaction and providing quality results along with recognized value to the devops teams.
